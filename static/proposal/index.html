    <!--Application Overview-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Application Overview</h1>
    <p>Website that generates a random password based on input and time of day. Inputs will use parameters such as using at least one <br>
        capital letter or a digit. It will also make use of a database full of phrases that can be mixed around in the generated password <br>
        as phrases are known to be much stronger when creating a password instead of random letters or numbers. Users will be able to create<br>
        an account on our website with a username and password, and the generation of passwords should be unique for every user so that an <br>
        adversary can't use this website to just generate passwords that someone coudl've gotten from this website and brute force their way<br>
        into any accounts they have set up with anybody else. This would be a big problem, and it's important that such a thing will never<br>
        happen in order to protect our users and make them feel confident in our product.</p>

    <!--TEAM NOTES: Just need to type your ideas in the paragraph tags and it should be good-->
    <!--Technology Overview-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Technology Overview</h1>
    <p>This site will utilize a variation of the MEAN stack which includes MongoDB for document database management, Node.js, <br> 
        Express, and HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (over Angular) on the client-side. Microsoft Azure is the cloud <br>
        computing service that will be employed for hosting and the project will be managed on GitHub with Git Version Control.
